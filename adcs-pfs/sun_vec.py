# SUN_VEC Computes unit vector from origin of ECI frame to sun
#
#  [sun_equ] = sun_vec(start_day)
#
#  Inputs:    start_day    int: days since 00:00:00 01/06/1980
#
#  Outputs:   sun_equ      [3,1] Earth-Sun vector in an ECI frame
#
#  Given start_day measured in days since 01/06/80, computes true
#  longitude of the Sun.  Earth-Sun vector is then computed in the
#  ecliptic plane, and is rotated into the ECI frame (equatorial
#  plane).  # ephemeris days assumed equal to # Julian days
#  The Earth-Sun vector rotates approximately 1.02 deg/day
